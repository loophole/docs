There are no hidden charges, nothing! You can continue to use Loophole as you did in the past. All our features including, custom domain names, long tunnel active times, and directory shares remain free and open to use.  You may ask, what\u2019s the catch? Well, we do need some financial support to run our infrastructure. To cover up the expenses, we plan to ask for donations.

These services are reverse proxies that allow you to expose your local development server. For now, we focus on Loophole. Simply because it offers all of its premium services free of use in its current beta version. Follow along and learn how to put this into your toolbelt of applications.\\n\\n\\n**How to?**\\n\\nBefore we dive deep into using Loophole, let us have our web app running. If you do not have a web app to test, you could use a simple Node js app as shown below. This app is running on port 8000.\\n\\n:::note Note\\nThe webapp is running on port 8000\\n:::\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst os = require(\'os\');\\nconst express = require(\'express\');\\n\\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 8000;\\nconst app = express();\\n\\napp.get(\'/*\', function (req, res) {\\n  const hostname = os.hostname();\\n  res.json({hostname, version: \'2\'});\\n});\\n\\napp.listen(port, () => {\\n  console.log(`demo-app listening on port ${port}`);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**Moving On!**\\n\\nNow that our web app is running on our local server, let us start by downloading the right binary file of Loophole. This process is broken down into three simple steps:\\n\\n1. [Download Loophole for your OS](/download)\\n2. Unpack it (Unzip).\\n3. Launch CMD and go to the file downloaded path.\\n\\nTa-dah! you are one step close now.\\n\\nHere we will try establishing a loophole tunnel for Windows. It would be easy peasy for Linux and macOS too. I have moved the loophole file to my home directory. \\n\\n:::note Note\\nThe custom domain name is reserved for the next 30 days under your account from the day of first usage. Whereas, random generated URLs are only valid for 60 minutes.\\n:::\\n\\n**Now, let\'s play!**\\n\\nRemember, our local web app was running on 8000 port. Let us share this with Loophole and see it\'s magic.\\n\\n``` \\nloophole 8000 --hostname <yourdomainname>\\n```\\n\\n\\n![Tunnel](/img/blog/loophole_12_domain.gif)\\n\\n\\nThe flag ```--hostname``` lets you set a custom domain name. This is an ideal scenario while sharing it with the client and wouldn\'t prefer sharing a random generated domain URL. I have used the name ```qrtesting``` as my custom domain name. You are free to choose any name that you like. \\n\\n\\n\\n**QR code? Why not.**\\n\\nWhile loophole is being used mainly for the testing environment, another ideal use case is to share locally created feedback forms to a large audience or survey forms for your upcoming product. To ease this process, you can now generate QR codes along with your custom domains by simply using \\n\\n```\\nloophole 8000 -qr --hostname <yourdomainname>\\n```\\n\\n![Tunnel](/img/blog/loophole_12_domain_qr.gif)\\n\\n\\nThis fires up a bunch of commands. notice, the link ```https://qrtesting.loophole.site``` points to our local port 8000 where our sample app is hosted. You can share this link with your friends and colleagues and have your server running locally.\\n\\n\\n:::tip Tip\\nThe web url will be live till the time your local tunnel is running. It automatically terminates once loophole session is terminated. \\n:::\\n\\n\\nIf you have any questions or want to share your experience with us, feel free to write to us at loophole@main.dev.

It provides a user-friendly domain that you can share with your remote users/friends/teammates to try/use your WebApp. \\n\\n**Let\'s give it a try!**\\n\\nFirstly, create an account with Loophole . By creating an account, you get access to all the features loophole provides in its beta version. Next, [Download the latest version of Loophole here.](/download)\\n\\n**Getting Started**\\n \\nIn windows, click the loophole.zip file to unzip. \\n\\nFor Mac and Linux, use terminal with the following command:\\n\\n \\n```bash\\n$ unzip /path/to/loophole.zip\\n```\\n\\n**Authenticating Loophole CLI for all feature access**\\n\\nOnce you\'ve signed up, you need to configure loophole with the authtoken.with authtoken, you get access to account-only features. Loophole has a simple \'account\' command to make this easy. Under the hood, the login command adds (or modify) the authtoken property in your loophole configuration file. \\n\\n![Login](/img/blog/2020/loophole_12_login.gif)\\n\\n**Running our local server project**\\n\\nMeanwhile, we need to have a webapp running. Here we consider a simple gatsby server for representation purposes.\\n\\n:::note Note\\nThe webapp is running on port 8000\\n:::\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst os = require(\'os\');\\nconst express = require(\'express\');\\n\\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 8000;\\nconst app = express();\\n\\napp.get(\'/*\', function (req, res) {\\n  const hostname = os.hostname();\\n  res.json({hostname, version: \'2\'});\\n});\\n\\napp.listen(port, () => {\\n  console.log(`demo-app listening on port ${port}`);\\n});\\n```\\nNow all we have to do is let Loophole know the port our local server is running on! After authentication,follow the below instructions:\\n\\n\\n![Tunnel](/img/blog/2020-10-29-get-started-with-loophole/8000.gif)\\n\\n\\n:::tip Tip\\nIf your app is running on a different port, just replace 8000 with your respective port.\\n:::\\n\\n**Example** - For an app running on port 3000, the command will be \\n\\n```bash\\n$ loophole http 3000\\n\\n# or for 1.0.0-beta.8 and older\\n$ loophole 3000\\n```\\nand it fires a HTTPS secured tunnel for you.\\n\\nYour website is now **LIVE**!\\n\\n**Share the URL with people you want to show your web application. It is that simple**\\n\\nThere are endless possibilities with Loophole. You can create a custom domain, or share a QR code than a URL. I would cover those features individually in other blog posts. For more details, you can refer to the [documentation](/docs) here."},{"id":"expose-yourself-to-the-world","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/expose-yourself-to-the-world","source":"@site/blog/2020-10-21-expose-yourself-to-the-world.md","title":"Expose yourself to the world!","description":"Local development environment makes the process fast and easy to test as you change your code continuously.","date":"2020-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 21, 2020","tags":[{"label":"quickstart","permalink":"/blog/tags/quickstart"},{"label":"tunnel","permalink":"/blog/tags/tunnel"},{"label":"hosting","permalink":"/blog/tags/hosting"},{"label":"cli","permalink":"/blog/tags/cli"}],"readingTime":1.34,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Aman Kalra","title":"Loophole Core Team","url":"https://github.com/amankalra172","imageURL":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/49478659?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"type":"blog","slug":"expose-yourself-to-the-world","title":"Expose yourself to the world!","author":"Aman Kalra","author_title":"Loophole Core Team","author_url":"https://github.com/amankalra172","author_image_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/49478659?v=4","tags":["quickstart","tunnel","hosting","cli"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Get Started with Loophole!","permalink":"/blog/get-started-with-loophole"}},"content":"Local development environment makes the process fast and easy to test as you change your code continuously. \\nBut in doing so, you might run into situations where you need to make it available publicly via an accessible URL while you\u2019re still in the development phase. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**Loophole helps you expose yourself to the world. Share your development environment with much ease**\\n\\nDid you ever wish to show your work to a client or colleague, or hoped for a secure, publicly available callback URL to interact with a web service. A complicated way includes uploading your application to a hosting platform like Heroku or AWS, but every time you update your code, you\u2019d have to push those changes to your host server. Tedious and not a favorable approach, right?\\n\\n\\n![collaboration](/img/blog/undraw_real_time_collaboration_c62i.svg)\\n*source: [undraw.co](https://undraw.co)*\\n\\n\\n**Staying Agile**\\n\\nLoophole comes into play here. Loophole can be your next utility kit that creates an instantly secure, publicly accessible tunnel URL to an application that\u2019s running on the localhost. In short, you can expose your local web server, APIs, databases, etc. So, It\u2019s easier to expose your services when you don\u2019t have big changes and don\u2019t want to deploy it in your development environment.\\n\\nLoophole can take any HTTP service, on any network, particularly private ones, and expose it to the rest of the Internet. Developers that create applications want to share them, and with Loophole, they can enjoy lower costs, increased portability, and productivity.\\n\\nFor technology enthusiasts that want to self-host their own services, their costs are reduced. The network configuration is simplified. Most importantly, their data is stored on their computers."}]}')}}]);
