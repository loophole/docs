All information you give us is held with the utmost care and security. We at Loophole are committed to protecting your privacy. If you‚Äôre visiting our websites, using our services, working with any of our teams, meeting us at events, or applying for a role with us, this privacy policy sets out what data we collect, and how we use it. It also describes your rights regarding our use of your data. Please take the time to review this privacy policy as it sets out our privacy practices and tells you how we will treat your personal information. We do not sell, rent, or loan any identifiable information regarding our customers to any third party. Only in the circumstances described within this Privacy Policy would we share your information with any third party. Our use of personal data is in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).</p><h4>Identity of the controller</h4><p>Main Development GmbH<br>Olvensteder Stra√üe 11A, 39108 Magdeburg</p><h4>Data Access at our Site</h4><h5>Personal data</h5><p>Pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (‚ÄúGDPR‚Äú), personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‚Äòdata subject‚Äô). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p><h5>Information Collection and Use</h5><p>We may collect personal data (including, without limitation, age, birthdate, address, email address, phone number, and geographic location) from customers both online and offline. Online, we may collect information through our website or through other online avenues. In many cases, such information will be collected directly from you, such as through registration, a transaction or inquiry (including via a telephone call) or your submission of a form, registration, or communication to us. Information may also be gathered from third-party sources, such as third-party service providers, opt-in lists, publicly available data, consumer reporting agencies, other companies, and referrals, and through your activities and interactions with us, including, without limitation, your online activity on our website. We may combine data collected from these disparate sources unless we tell you otherwise. As you use our website, some information can be ‚Äúpassively‚Äù collected using various technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, and navigational and location data collection (clickstream, log files, server logs). Your Internet browser automatically transmits some of this information, such as the URL of the website you just visited and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and browser version currently being used by your computer. Such technologies help us to keep track of your interactions with our website and provide you with a more customized experience. We use personal data about customers for a wide range of purposes. We use it to respond to your requests; to provide products or services that you have ordered; to process your order transactions and contact you regarding your order; to allow you to post information and other content online; to improve our products and website; to follow up with you after you have communicated with us or submitted information to us; to send promotional communications or offers (unless you have requested that we not send such communications); for marketing, research and legal purposes and other purposes (including, without limitation, call center recordings); to address your interests and concerns; and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy and/or at the point of personal data collection. We may disclose personal data you provide to consultants, service providers, and contractors that we use to support our business and operations who have agreed to keep the information confidential and use it only to provide the applicable service(s). In some cases, we work with other companies who help to gather information from you or help us to communicate with you. We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties for any marketing or commercial purposes. We may also disclose personal data to third parties (including, without limitation, governmental agencies) if required to do so by law, regulation or court order; to respond to governmental and/or law enforcement requests; to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with our (or others&#x27;) rights or property; to support any actual or threatened claim, defense or declaration in a case or before any jurisdictional and/or administrative authority, arbitration or mediation panel; or in connection with disciplinary actions/investigations. We may also disclose personal data to third parties in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of our website or the sale, assignment, merger, reorganization, or other transfer of our brand or company. The recipients of customers‚Äô personal data, and more generally these disclosures, may be located in Germany or other jurisdictions that might not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction. By submitting personal data to us, you consent to the transfer of such personal data outside your jurisdiction. We may make full use of all information that is de-identified or otherwise not in personally identifiable form. We may also make full use of all user-generated content you submit to us, in accordance with our Terms of Use.</p><h5>Intended Audience of Websites</h5><p>Our website is not directed to children under the age of 18. As a result, our website does not request or knowingly collect personal data from individuals under the age of 18. If you are not 18 or older, you should not visit or use our website.</p><h5>Contact Preferences; Opt-In and Opt-Out</h5><p>We would like to keep in touch with you in ways that you find to be beneficial. If you don‚Äôt want us to use your contact information to communicate with you for promotional purposes, please tell us that when you provide your contact information. You can also let us know your preference later by clicking on this link and following the instructions on that page or by following the instructions in various communications that we may send you. Keep in mind that these preferences regarding promotional contacts do not mean that we might not contact you for other reasons, such as those related to an order you placed, an inquiry you made, a legally required notice, and so on.</p><h5>RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT</h5><p>Right of Confirmation. Each data subject has the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal information concerning him or her is being processed. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. Right of Access. Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal information stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information: the purposes of the processing; the categories of personal information concerned; the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal information have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organizations; where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal information will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal information, or restriction of processing of personal information concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing; the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; where the personal information are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source; the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. Moreover, the data subject has the right to obtain information as to whether personal information is transferred to a third country or to an international organization. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of access, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. Right to Rectify. Each data subject has the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal information concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal information completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, they may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. Right to Erasure. Each data subject has the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal information concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal information without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary: The personal information are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed. The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing. The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR. Personal information has been unlawfully processed. The personal information must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The personal information has been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR. If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal information stored by the Controller, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. The Data Protection Officer of Controller or another employee shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately. Right of restriction of the processing. Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies: The accuracy of the personal information is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal information. The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal information and requests restriction of their use instead. The controller no longer needs the personal information for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject. Right to Portability. Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal information concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal information has been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal information transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact the Data Protection Officer designated by Company or another employee. Right to Object. Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal information concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions. This data controller shall no longer process the personal information in the event of the objection unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The right to withdraw data protection consent. Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to the processing of his or her personal information at any time. If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw consent, he or she may at any time directly contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. Provision of personal information as a statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal information; possible consequences of failure to provide such data We clarify that the provision of personal information is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal information, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with some personal information when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal information would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal information is provided by the data subject, in this circumstance the data subject must contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal information is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal information and the consequences of non-provision of the personal information.</p><h5>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h5><p>BY USING THIS WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU AS THE DATA SUBJECT CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
