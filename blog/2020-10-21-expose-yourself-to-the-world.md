Local development environment makes the process fast and easy to test as you change your code continuously. 
But in doing so, you might run into situations where you need to make it available publicly via an accessible URL while you’re still in the development phase.

**Loophole helps you expose yourself to the world. Share your development environment with much ease**

Did you ever wish to show your work to a client or colleague, or hoped for a secure, publicly available callback URL to interact with a web service. A complicated way includes uploading your application to a hosting platform like Heroku or AWS, but every time you update your code, you’d have to push those changes to your host server. Tedious and not a favorable approach, right?

**Staying Agile**

Loophole comes into play here. Loophole can be your next utility kit that creates an instantly secure, publicly accessible tunnel URL to an application that’s running on the localhost. In short, you can expose your local web server, APIs, databases, etc. So, It’s easier to expose your services when you don’t have big changes and don’t want to deploy it in your development environment.

Loophole can take any HTTP service, on any network, particularly private ones, and expose it to the rest of the Internet. Developers that create applications want to share them, and with Loophole, they can enjoy lower costs, increased portability, and productivity.

For technology enthusiasts that want to self-host their own services, their costs are reduced. The network configuration is simplified. Most importantly, their data is stored on their computers.
